## **Welcome to my website! â˜º**

My name is Conner and I currently work as a Research Technician in the [Beltran Lab](https://roxannebeltran.sites.ucsc.edu) at UCSC!

I'm interested in contributing to research programs that study animal movement, facilitate environmental stewardship through science communication, and follow the FAIR principles of open data.

## **Education**

I will soon be applying to PhD programs (please wish me luck!)

*University of California, Santa Cruz*

BS in Marine Biology with a Minor in Literature \| 2022
