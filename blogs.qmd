-   Right now its 6:21 pm and I have been working on this website for about an hour now [update as of 03/12/23: I ended up spending 3 hours working on it hehehe]. I am having so much fun :D This morning I had my Año shift and we (Patrick, Millie, Maddie, Mando, and I) weighed 9 weans (with 4 being known moms)!! Woohoo!

Since my last update I emailed the STARESO researchers and got permission from them to use their temperature data in our Corsica paper :) Submitting my PISCO application tomorrow (AHHHHH!) and then going to Año on Saturday and Monday!
